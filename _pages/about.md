Welcome to my personal website! My name is Michael Nelson and I am a life-long computer scientist with a PhD from the University of Oklahoma. My doctoral research was focused on time-evolving graph compression, but I am curious across all fields of computer science.

I am currently working at CoreLogic/cotality, as a **Lead Senior Software Engineer** on the greenfield Labs team. We specialize in building large-scale solutions from scratch using cutting-edge technologies and methodologies. 

My current interests span across many fields, but include:

- **Cloud Infrastructure**: I study and apply the latest in scalable and reliable architectures for both professional and personal projects using different cloud providers.
- **AI/ML Projects**: I am fascinated by the capabilities of AI such as large language models and their potential to revolutionize technology. I am particularly interested in automating processes with agents and function calling.
- **Software Development**: As a life-long coder, I enjoy experimenting with new languages, frameworks, and patterns. My current favorite stacks are Python/React and the T3 stack.
- **Web Apps**: I enjoy building modern web apps and APIs from scratch. These projects allow me to explore new technologies and frameworks while creating something useful.
- **Modding/DLL Injection**: As a gamer, I also found an interest in modding games and creating custom DLLs to enhance the gaming experience. Inspired by the FromSoft community, I am always on the lookout for new and exciting projects in this space.
