In addition to wanting to always improve my coding skills, I also am in charge of interviewing candidates for our teams. I have read many programming books, but this is my first time reading something from Alex Xu and ByteByteGo. I picked up this book along with System Design Interview volumes 1 and 2, which I will document in separate projects.

You can find my implementations in my [coding_interview_patterns](https://github.com/mnelson91/coding_interview_patterns) repository.

I have also reached out to the maintainers of the book and repository via their [Discord](bit.ly/coding-patterns-discord) server to provide feedback. They are open to pull requests and suggestions, although changes to the Python implementations—the primary language of the book—are more difficult to get approved. However, I have identified similar optimization opportunities in the implementations for other languages, which are updated more frequently and are more likely to be accepted.
