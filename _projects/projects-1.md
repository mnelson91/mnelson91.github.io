In addition to wanting to always improve my coding skills, I also am in charge of interviewing candidates for our teams. I have read many programming books, but this is my first time reading something from Alex Xu and ByteByteGo. I picked up this book along with System Design Interview volumes 1 and 2, which I will document in separate projects.

You can find my implementations in my [coding_interview_patterns](https://github.com/mnelson91/coding_interview_patterns) repository.
