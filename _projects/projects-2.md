System Design Interview Volume 2 by Alex Xu is a comprehensive guide that dives deep into advanced system design concepts. As someone who conducts technical interviews, I found this volume particularly valuable for its detailed coverage of real-world system design challenges. The book's practical approach to designing scalable and efficient systems, combined with its step-by-step problem-solving methodology, has greatly enhanced my understanding of complex system architecture.
