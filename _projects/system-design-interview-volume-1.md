System Design Interview Volume 1 by Alex Xu serves as an excellent introduction to system design concepts. As someone who conducts technical interviews, I found this first volume particularly valuable for its clear explanations of fundamental system design principles. The book's structured approach to breaking down complex system design problems, combined with its practical examples, has provided me with a solid foundation for evaluating system design solutions.
